## Kanban Board Check
- Fetch tasks from http://localhost:3333/api/tasks
- Look for tasks in "backlog" column — pick up the highest priority one and move it to "inprogress"
- Work on any task currently in "inprogress" assigned to Jarvis
- When a task is done, move it to "review" (so Jordan can verify)
- For "recurring" tasks, check if they need attention today
- If you complete work, commit and push to the jarvis-builds repo
