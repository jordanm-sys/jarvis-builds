# 🌺 Kauai Trip Plan — The Garden Isle

> **7-Day Itinerary** · Budget-friendly with splurge options · Perfect for a uni student adventure

---

## 📍 Quick Facts

- **Island:** Kauaʻi (oldest main Hawaiian island)
- **Nickname:** The Garden Isle
- **Size:** ~552 sq mi — you can drive around most of it in a few hours
- **Airport:** Līhuʻe (LIH)
- **Must-have:** Rental car (absolutely essential — no Uber/Lyft reliability here)
- **Vibe:** Laid-back, lush, dramatic landscapes, way less touristy than Maui/Oʻahu

---

## 🚗 Getting Around

- **Rent a car.** Non-negotiable. Book early — prices spike close to your dates.
- **Budget tip:** Book through Discount Hawaii Car Rental or Costco Travel for best rates.
- **Gas stations** are limited on the north and west sides — fill up in Līhuʻe or Kapaʻa.
- **No road circles the island** — the Na Pali Coast blocks the northwest, so you'll often drive out and back the same way.

## 🎒 What to Bring

- **Reef-safe sunscreen** (required by Hawaii law! Regular sunscreen damages coral)
- **Water shoes** — rocky shores and muddy trails
- **Rain jacket** — Kauai is one of the wettest places on Earth (especially north shore)
- **Good hiking shoes** — trails are muddy; don't rely on flip-flops
- **Dry bag** — for kayaking and beach days
- **Snorkel gear** — buy a cheap set at Costco/Walmart to avoid $15-20/day rentals
- **Reusable water bottle** — hydration is key
- **Bug spray** — mosquitoes near rivers and trails
- **Headlamp/flashlight** — if doing early morning hikes

## 🧠 Pro Tips

1. **Book Hāʻena State Park permits early** — they sell out fast, especially for weekends. Go to [gohaena.com](https://gohaena.com)
2. **Mornings are best** — for hiking (before clouds), snorkeling (calmer water), and beating crowds
3. **The north shore is wetter** — south shore (Poipu) is your sunny backup plan
4. **Respect the ʻāina (land)** — stay on marked trails, don't stack rocks, take only photos
5. **Monk seals and sea turtles** — observe from distance (10+ ft). It's federal law.
6. **Wild chickens are everywhere** — yes, they'll wake you up at 5 AM. That's just Kauai.
7. **Gas up in town** — fill your tank in Kapaʻa or Līhuʻe before heading to remote areas
8. **No traffic lights on most of the island** — but rush hour in Kapaʻa is surprisingly real (avoid 4-6 PM)
9. **Sunset spots:** Kē'e Beach (north), Polihale (west), Poipu (south)
10. **Check surf conditions** — north shore has big swells in winter, south shore calmer
