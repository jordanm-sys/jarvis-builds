## 9. Honest Advice for a Beginner

1. **Don't overspend on tools before you've made a sale.** Start with the Broke Student Stack. Tools don't make money — selling does.

2. **ChatGPT is your secret weapon.** Use it for product descriptions, ad copy, email sequences, customer service templates, and even business strategy. It replaces $100+/mo in specialized tools.

3. **Product research matters more than any tool.** Spend 80% of your time finding the right product. A great product with ugly ads will outsell a bad product with perfect ads.

4. **Start with one platform for ads.** TikTok organic (free) or Facebook paid ($5–20/day). Don't spread thin.

5. **AI won't replace judgment.** These tools surface data — you still need to evaluate product quality, supplier reliability, and brand fit. Order samples before selling.

6. **The real edge isn't tools — it's speed.** AI lets you test more products faster. The dropshippers winning in 2026 are testing 5–10 products per week, not agonizing over one for a month.

7. **Free trials are your friend.** Most tools offer 7-day trials. Use them strategically — spend a focused weekend doing research during a trial rather than signing up and forgetting.
