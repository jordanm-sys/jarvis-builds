# 🌺 Oahu, Hawaii — 7-Day Trip Plan from the Ilikai Hotel

> **Base Camp:** Ilikai Hotel & Luxury Suites, 1777 Ala Moana Blvd, Waikiki
> **Vibe:** University student — fun-first, budget-conscious, with room for a few splurges
> **Best for:** Any time of year (winter = bigger North Shore waves; summer = calmer water everywhere)

---

## 📍 Your Location Advantage: The Ilikai

The Ilikai sits at the **west end of Waikiki**, right where it meets Ala Moana. This is actually a killer spot because:

- **Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon** — calm, swimmable lagoon steps from the hotel (free, no crowds early AM)
- **Ala Moana Beach Park** — locals' beach, way less touristy than Waikiki proper. 5-min walk.
- **Ala Moana Center** — massive mall with 85+ restaurants, 5-min walk. Food court = budget heaven.
- **Hilton Hawaiian Village** — right next door, Friday night fireworks show (free to watch from your hotel!)
- You can walk into central Waikiki (~15 min to Royal Hawaiian Center) or escape tourist prices by going toward Ala Moana.
