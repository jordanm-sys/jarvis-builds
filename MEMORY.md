# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Jordan
- SFU business student (2nd year), wants CS minor
- Courses: CMPT 120, MACM 101, linear algebra
- Goals: AI-powered online business, workflow automation
- Interested in AI dropshipping but open to alternatives; also researched AI smart scale concept
- Busy schedule — school, gym, healthy eating
- Wants help with: product research, website building, ads, and eventually running a business
- Vibe: casual/sharp/snarky — read the room
- Prefers clean, consistent UI formatting (e.g. "In Xd" not mixed date formats)
- Wants dashboard summary to be MY personal recommendations with reasoning, not technical data dumps
- Wants all data refreshed daily — hates stale info

## Me (Jarvis)
- First boot: 2026-02-13
- Emoji: ⚡
- Adaptive tone
- **Be disciplined about daily notes** — write to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md during conversations, not just at the end
- **IMMEDIATE WRITE RULE**: When Jordan states a preference, gives a rule, or says "always/never do X" — stop and write it to MEMORY.md RIGHT NOW. Not later. Not at session end. Immediately. This is the #1 way things get forgotten.

## Infrastructure
- **Kanban board**: http://localhost:3333 (Tailscale: http://100.109.88.104:3333)
  - Tasks stored at: /Users/jordanmaragliano/.openclaw/workspace/kanban/tasks.json
  - API: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/tasks, PUT /api/tasks/:id/move
  - Jordan adds tasks → I pick them up and work on them
  - Move tasks: backlog → inprogress → review → done
  - Tasks link to projects via `projectId` — always set this when creating tasks/projects
  - Two-way sync: task column ↔ project reviewed status
  - Auto-polling UI (2s), no refresh needed
  - Managed by launchd (com.jarvis.kanban) — auto-restarts
  - **Summary tab**: `/api/stocks/summary` — I write a personal analyst note daily, stored in `summary.json`
  - **Summary format**: { sentiment, overall, picks: [{symbol, action, reasoning}], keyEvents }
  - Actions: buy / hold / trim / sell / watch
- **Fitness tracker**: http://localhost:3334 — managed by launchd (com.jarvis.fitness)
- **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/jordanm-sys/jarvis-builds — push all builds here
- **Brave Search**: configured and working
- **Telegram**: connected (bot paired with Jordan)
- **Discord**: configured
- **Models**: Claude Opus 4.6 (primary) → Gemini 2.5 Pro (fallback, free tier)
- **Research outputs**: always styled PDFs, readable, using puppeteer for HTML→PDF

## Cron Schedule (all PST, weekdays unless noted)
- **Webhook** — Kanban server instantly triggers Telegram notification when a new task is added (no cron needed)
- **7:25 AM** — Daily Earnings Calendar Refresh (Sonnet) — yfinance dates + Perplexity bull/bear cases for upcoming earnings + cleans old briefings/market insights
- **7:30 AM** — Portfolio Briefing (Sonnet) — prices, changes, news via Perplexity → posts to API + Telegram
- **7:35 AM** — Watchlist Briefing (Sonnet) — same for watchlist tickers
- **7:40 AM** — Market Insights (Sonnet) — sector rotations, opportunities, macro
- **7:45 AM** — Insider Trading Scan (Sonnet) — SEC EDGAR Form 4 filings via fetch-insiders.js
- **8:20 AM** — Options Flow Scan (Sonnet) — unusual options activity via fetch-options.js + yfinance
- **8:25 AM** — Jarvis Daily Summary (Opus) — my written analysis posted to /api/stocks/summary
- **Sunday 9 AM** — Weekly Memory Maintenance (Gemini) — review daily logs, update MEMORY.md
- **Task Watcher**: cron `b622ecbc-82c9-4c1a-a448-1cd296cbabe5` (Sonnet, every 30m + webhook instant trigger)
  - Task watcher ONLY moves tasks from backlog → inprogress. It does NOT build/complete tasks.
  - Main session (me) does the actual work when I see the task in inprogress.
- **Fun fact website**: http://localhost:3336 — managed by launchd (com.jarvis.funfact)
- **Heartbeats**: disabled (replaced by task watcher cron)

## Key Scripts
- `kanban/fetch-insiders.js` — SEC EDGAR Form 4 scraper, dedup, filters P/S only
- `kanban/fetch-options.js` — yfinance options chain scanner, unusual activity scoring
- `kanban/fetch-options-data.py` — Python helper for yfinance options data
- `kanban/refresh-earnings.js` — yfinance earnings date fetcher, updates API
- `kanban/fetch-earnings-dates.py` — Python helper for yfinance earnings dates

## Jordan's Portfolio
- **Tickers:** FBTC (CAD), SOXX, TE, MSFT, MU, FCX, AMPX, NBIS, CRWV, CIFR, IREN (all USD except FBTC)
- **Watchlist:** NVDA
- Heavy crypto mining / BTC exposure, semis, blue chips
- SOXX and FBTC are ETFs — no earnings
- **Insider alerts (as of Feb 23):** FCX 4 insiders selling $34M, CRWV 3 insiders selling $48M
- **Earnings week of Feb 24:** CIFR (Mon), NVDA (Tue), CRWV (Thu) — big week

## Workflow Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Backlog
- Jordan adds tasks here
- Check `schedule` field:
  - `"instant"` → start IMMEDIATELY, no waiting
  - ISO datetime → complete by that deadline
  - No schedule → pick up when nothing else is in progress
- **Priority tiebreaker**: If multiple tasks share the same schedule/time AND same priority, start with the one with earliest `createdAt`
- **Polling must work** — pick up tasks right away when added

### In Progress
- Two ways a task appears here:
  1. Jarvis picks up a backlog task → move it to inprogress
  2. Jordan asks me to build/do ANYTHING (even small) → I create a task in inprogress myself
- **EVERY piece of work must be visible here** — Jordan tracks what I'm doing via this column

### Review
- ALL completed inprogress tasks go to review
- **MUST have a clickable link** if applicable (website URL, PDF, etc.) that takes Jordan to the project in the Projects section
- **ALWAYS create a project and link it via projectId** — every task must have a projectId so Jordan can click through
- Create the project FIRST (POST /api/projects), get the ID, THEN update the task with that projectId
- Use logic to pick the right project subsection (websites, research, etc.)
- If no good subsection exists, create a new one with a logical heading

### Done
- **ONLY Jordan moves tasks here** — never Jarvis
- Tasks move review → done when Jordan sets it to "reviewed" in Projects, or drags it in Tasks
- Works vice versa too (two-way sync between task column and project reviewed status)

### Recurring
- Used to track recurring tasks (crons, scheduled checks, etc.)
- Always add recurring tasks here (stock briefings, insider scans, options flow, etc.)

## Decisions & Lessons
- **All research outputs must be styled PDFs** (readable, using puppeteer for HTML→PDF) unless Jordan specifies otherwise
- **Research PDFs must be downloadable** — always use `Content-Disposition: attachment` so anyone with the link can download, not just view inline
- **PDF downloads on the dashboard must work on mobile** — kanban has a `/api/download?url=&filename=` proxy for cross-port PDFs. All research projects get a ⬇️ button that routes through this proxy. Already set up for current and future PDFs.
- **ALWAYS verify project links work before sending to Jordan** — test every URL (curl the actual link). Never send a broken link.
- **ALWAYS attach the correct project/PDF links** — double-check the URL matches the actual project, not a stale or wrong one
- Briefing crons should NOT write to earnings data — that's the refresh script's job (avoids Perplexity overwriting good yfinance data)
- Old briefings/market insights should be auto-cleaned (7 days / 5 days) to prevent stale accumulation
- ETF notes should be static ("ETF — no earnings") not dynamic countdown text
- Earnings status badges should always show "In Xd" format, never mixed with date strings
- Summary tab should be Jarvis-written analysis, not auto-generated technical signals
- Task watcher cron (Gemini, 2 min) is better than frequent heartbeats (Opus) for task pickup
