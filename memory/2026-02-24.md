# 2026-02-24 (Monday)

## Morning Crons
- All 6 morning crons ran on schedule (7:25-8:25 AM)
- 3 of 4 Telegram sends failed (portfolio, watchlist, market insights) — caught and re-sent manually
- Insider scan and options flow delivered fine on their own
- Jordan asked me to verify crons ran — completed and moved to review

## Project Management Board Overhaul
Jordan gave detailed instructions on how the board should work. Key rules:

### Workflow (locked into MEMORY.md)
- **Backlog**: Jordan adds tasks. Check schedule field — instant = NOW, ISO datetime = deadline, none = when free
- **Priority tiebreaker**: same schedule + same priority → earliest createdAt wins
- **In Progress**: Two entry paths — (1) Jarvis picks up backlog task, (2) Jordan asks me to do anything → I create task in inprogress myself
- **Review**: ALL completed tasks go here with clickable link + projectId. Create project FIRST, get ID, link task.
- **Done**: ONLY Jordan moves tasks here (via reviewed in Projects or drag in Tasks)
- **Recurring**: Track all recurring tasks with schedule fields

### Task Watcher Rebuilt
- Old cron was dead (stale ID in webhook). Created new one: `b622ecbc-82c9-4c1a-a448-1cd296cbabe5`
- Sonnet model, every 30 min + instant webhook trigger from kanban server
- Tested: added instant task → picked up in ~10 seconds ✅
- **Critical fix**: Task watcher ONLY moves tasks. Does NOT build/complete them. Main session does real work.
- Previous version (before fix) actually built a fun fact website on its own — bad behavior, now corrected

### Recurring Schedule UI
- Added structured schedule input to the board for recurring tasks
- Frequency: Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Custom cron
- Weekly: day checkboxes (Mon-Sun)
- Monthly: day of month picker
- Time picker (PST), defaults 9:00 AM
- Cards show readable label like "🔄 Mon, Wed, Fri at 9:00 AM"
- Applied schedule fields to all 8 existing recurring tasks

### Fun Fact Websites Built
- Cat (port 3336), Monkey (3337), Sloth (3338), Shark (3339), Gorilla (3340)
- All with Express servers, launchd auto-restart, projects created and linked
- Jordan said these were just tests

### Key Lessons
- Don't ask Jordan to do things I should've already done (e.g. "want me to set up the project?")
- Every completed task MUST have project + clickable link automatically
- Task watcher should never do real work — only move tasks
- Launch Claude Code with --yolo next time to avoid permission prompt hell
- When Jordan sends audio, I can't transcribe (no Whisper/OpenAI API key)
- Jordan accidentally sent a password — told him to change it, didn't store it

## Market
- BTC crashed below $65K — 6th consecutive down week
- CIFR earnings tomorrow, NVDA Wednesday, CRWV Thursday
- My calls: BUY MU, TRIM CRWV, HOLD most, WATCH NVDA
