# 2026-02-18 — Daily Notes

## Kanban Improvements
- Added review/reviewed badges to projects (yellow/green, fixed 80px width)
- Added "incomplete" status with reason field for failed builds
- Date moved to top-right of project cards
- Explicit `projectId` linking between tasks and projects (no more fuzzy matching)
- Full two-way sync: task review↔done syncs with project review↔reviewed badges
- Click task in review/done → navigates to linked project in Projects tab
- Auto-polling every 2 seconds so UI updates without refresh
- Set up launchd plists for kanban (port 3333) and fitness tracker (port 3334) — auto-restart on crash, start on boot
- All research files now output as styled PDFs by default

## Gemini Fallback Configured
- Added Google Gemini 2.5 Pro as fallback model via models.providers config
- API key: AIzaSyD4Vb3hs0lEiHuuLHgm4WNlkoBc21O3q5k (free tier)
- Fallback order: Claude Opus 4.6 → Gemini 2.5 Pro (replaced Sonnet 4)

## Research Created
- Spring Break 2026 Trip Plan (PDF) — 4 destinations from Vancouver, Mexico City recommended
- 3-Day Waikiki Plan (PDF) — day-by-day itinerary for Jordan's current Hawaii trip

## Jordan's Investment Portfolio

- Heavy crypto/BTC mining (FBTC, CRWV, CIFR, IREN), semis (SOXX, MU, AMPX), blue chips (MSFT, TE, FCX)
- FBTC is in CAD, rest in USD
- Wants daily 8am PST stock briefing via Telegram — quick summary + deep dive
- Still waiting for confirmation if IREN is the last ticker before setting up cron job

## Jordan in Hawaii
- Currently in Waikiki, Oahu — 3 days left
- Accessing kanban via Tailscale: http://100.109.88.104:3333

## Kanban CSS Details (for future reference)
- Project card footer uses CSS grid: `grid-template-columns: auto 80px 1fr auto`
- Puppeteer installed at `/tmp/node_modules/puppeteer` for PDF generation
- Frontend replaces `localhost` with `window.location.hostname` in project links (~line 250)

## Preferences Noted
- All research outputs must be readable PDFs
- Projects need review badges synced with task status
- Wants explicit task↔project linking, no fuzzy matching
- Interested in AI agents for market research (discussed Perplexity, Gemini, Grok)
- Sticking with free stack for now (Brave + Gemini sub-agents)
