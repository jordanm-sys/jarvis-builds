      "analysis": "The dominant overnight story is NVIDIA: Q4 FY26 revenue of $68.1 billion crushed guidance by ~$3B and beat consensus of $66.2B, with 73% YoY growth. Data Center drove the bulk of results. However, after-hours reaction was muted — hovering between -1% and +1% — classic sell-the-news exhaustion after an event traders had been positioned for. This means the SOXX/NBIS/CRWV/IREN tailwind at the open may be modest rather than explosive.\n\nThe CRWV earnings tonight (AMC Feb 26) is the single biggest portfolio catalyst of the day. With options pricing +-15.21 points on a ~$99 stock (~15%), the binary risk is real. Consensus expects ~$1.55B revenue, the $55.6B backlog (doubled QoQ) is the bull case, while the class action lawsuit + debt overhang + EPS loss widening are bear risks.\n\nFCX faces a nuanced setup: copper is at record prices globally BUT a Feb 26 article flags global inventories hitting 23-year highs — the copper paradox. Record prices may have priced in the bull case. Still, Grasberg extension and 58%+ EPS growth expected 2026 keep the thesis intact near-term.\n\nIREN remains under pressure — Q2 2026 miss (EPS -$0.52 vs -$0.18 expected, Feb 5) led to a Sell downgrade. The Microsoft $9.7B GPU contract is the long-term anchor but near-term sentiment is bearish.\n\nFBTC/BTC complex is grinding lower. YTD -26.48% for the Canadian ETF is brutal. No clear catalyst for reversal yet.\n\nMU at $429 is approaching its ATH ($437.80) and is the strongest technical setup in the portfolio heading into Mar 18 earnings."
