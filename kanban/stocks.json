The stock has been range-bound around $185-$193 since the DeepSeek rotation selloff from $209+ levels in January. Tonight is the moment of truth: Blackwell ramp execution, Q1 FY27 guidance (consensus expects approaching $75B), and gross margin trajectory will all be scrutinized. Bull case: Blackwell beats hard, Q1 guide above $75B, margins hold above 75% → re-rating toward $220-$250 range. Bear case: Guidance disappoints at ~$70B or below, export headwinds widen, in-house chip competition accelerates → potential pullback to $150 support. This result will also set the tone for the broader AI infrastructure trade — directly impacting SOXX, CRWV, NBIS, and IREN in the portfolio. Elevated implied volatility; expect a significant gap up or down at tomorrow open. 92% analyst buy ratings with avg PT around $260 suggests the market still believes in the long-term Nvidia supercycle thesis."
