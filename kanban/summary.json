  "sentiment": "mixed",
  "overall": "This is the biggest week of the year for the portfolio. CIFR reports tomorrow, NVDA Wednesday, CRWV Thursday. BTC crashing below $65K is hammering your crypto exposure, and CRWV insiders have dumped $48M in shares while a class action lawsuit was just filed. The good news: MU is on fire with analyst upgrades, FCX got a double upgrade, and the broader tech oversold bounce is setting up. Buckle up.",
  "picks": [
    {
      "symbol": "CIFR",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Earnings TOMORROW. BTC crashing below $65K is terrible timing at $14.30 with bearish technicals. COO Patrick Kelly sold $552K last week. The AI data center pivot ($9.3B pipeline) is the real story. Hold through earnings but set a mental stop around $12. If BTC keeps bleeding and they miss, this gets ugly fast."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NVDA",
      "action": "watch",
      "reasoning": "Earnings Wednesday AMC, the single most important event this week. Consensus $65B rev, $1.53 EPS, 94.5% beat rate. CFO Colette Kress sold ~$8.5M at $172-179 (routine 10b5-1). Morningstar fair value $240 vs current $190. If they guide Q1 to $75B+, it drags SOXX, CRWV, NBIS, and IREN higher. Do NOT buy ahead of the print."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "CRWV",
      "action": "trim",
      "reasoning": "Earnings Thursday but the red flags are screaming. CEO Intrator, CSO Venturo, and CDO McBee collectively dumped $48.3M in shares over two weeks. Morgan Stanley downgraded. Blue Owl failed a $4B debt placement. Class action lawsuit filed. The $55B backlog is real but $29B in debt with insiders running for the exits is a clear trim signal."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "MU",
      "action": "buy",
      "reasoning": "Zacks #1 Strong Buy with 4 analyst upgrades in 60 days. Morgan Stanley PT $450 vs current $428. HBM demand for AI is the real deal. EVP Sadana sold $10.7M and CLO Ray sold $3.2M but thats routine at these levels. Earnings March 18, time to accumulate. Highest-conviction semi name right now."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "FCX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Double upgrade day with Freedom Capital Buy/$76 and Scotiabank $72. Copper above $14K/ton, Grasberg extension confirmed. BUT Chairman Adkerson sold $25.5M and three other insiders sold $8.5M combined. Thesis intact and upgrades validate it, but that insider selling keeps this a hold not a buy. Earnings April 23."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMPX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Earnings in 10 days (March 5). Defense battery demand is strong, stock rallied 4.4% twice last week. CTO Stefan sold $7.3M in January which is notable for a $10 stock. Fair value estimate $17.57 gives significant upside. Hold into earnings but keep position small, this is speculative."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NBIS",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Nvidia maintaining its stake is the bull case in one sentence. Tavily acquisition deepens AI software stack. 508% expected revenue growth in 2026. But the -9% single-day drop shows volatility risk. At $97 with PT $142-152, hold your position but do NOT add on green days. Wait for pullbacks to $90."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "IREN",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "BTC crashing to $64K is brutal for miners, down 3.7% today. But the $9.7B Microsoft AI contract and 140K GPU target make this more AI than miner. Unusual bullish options flow on March $41.50-$50 calls. Earnings May 13. Hold but watch BTC closely. If it breaks $60K, reconsider."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "FBTC",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "BTC broke below $65K support, 6th consecutive down week on tariff tensions and whale selling. At ~$29.60 CAD, well off the $110 high. Pure BTC proxy. I think BTC recovers medium-term but near-term pain is not over. Hold but do not add until BTC reclaims $68K."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "SOXX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Semis holding at $359 ahead of NVDA earnings. High put volume signals hedging. Citi added TXN and MPWR as top picks. This ETF lives and dies by the NVDA print Wednesday. Hold and let earnings dictate the next move."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "MSFT",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Drifting at $396, down 21% over 6 months on AI capex concerns. Director Stanton bought $2M in shares, a bullish insider signal. Heavy bullish 0DTE call flow today at $387-395 strikes (scores 85-90). Analysts still see $592 PT. Earnings April 29. Boring but undervalued. Patient hold."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "TE",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Quietest name in the portfolio at $6.30. CAO termination raises governance questions. Treasury 45X tax credit supports the solar thesis. Earnings March 24. No insider activity, no unusual options. This is a show-me story. Hold small position but no reason to add until they prove execution."
