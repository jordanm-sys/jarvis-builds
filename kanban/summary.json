  "sentiment": "bearish",
  "overall": "Rough week for the portfolio. CRWV's 19% post-earnings crash is dragging the entire AI infra complex down, NVDA is selling off despite a triple beat, and BTC keeps grinding lower. The macro rotation out of tech into industrials and energy has more legs — your cyclical exposure (FCX) is the bright spot, but most of your high-beta names are under real pressure heading into the weekend.",
  "picks": [
    {
      "symbol": "AMPX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Earnings in 6 days (Mar 5) — this is a binary event. 9/9 analysts rate Buy with avg PT $16.63 vs ~$10.72 price. BUT your CTO Stefan Constantin has been dumping shares aggressively — $6.4M+ sold since January, and director Sun Kang sold $622K on Feb 23. That insider selling ahead of earnings is a yellow flag. Don't add before the print."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "MU",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Earnings Mar 18 (19 days). Strongest technical setup in the portfolio near ATH at ~$422-425. Zacks #1 Strong Buy, Morgan Stanley PT $450. EVP Sadana sold $10.7M in early Feb which is notable but typical for execs near ATH. The HBM/AI memory demand story is intact — this is your best earnings setup."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "CRWV",
      "action": "trim",
      "reasoning": "Down 19% to ~$81 after Q1 guidance missed consensus by 15% ($1.9-2.0B vs $2.24B) and FY26 capex doubled to $30-35B. Six insiders including CEO Intrator, CSO Venturo, and CDO McBee dumped $43M+ in shares in the weeks before earnings — that's not normal pre-lockup selling, that's people who knew the guide would disappoint. JPMorgan cut PT to $90, Mizuho to $95. Trim into any bounce."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NVDA",
      "action": "watch",
      "reasoning": "Triple beat ($68.1B rev, $1.62 EPS, $78B Q1 guide) and it's still down 6% today at ~$185. Classic sell-the-news in a rotation environment. CFO Kress sold ~$8.5M in early Feb. Options flow is actually mixed — heavy $182.5 call buying ($7.7M premium) but also $160 put activity. At $185 with a $270 consensus PT, the valuation is compelling but the tape is fighting you. Wait for $175 support to hold before adding."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "TE",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Earnings Mar 24 (25 days). Quiet at ~$6.68 with no real catalyst. Tax credit confirmation and solar demand ramp are the thesis but the CAO termination governance issue lingers. Low conviction name — it's not hurting you but it's not doing much either."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "FCX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Your best performer — copper near records and the stock is at ~$68. Options flow is bullish ($65 and $66 calls active with $2.5M premium). However, Chairman Adkerson sold $25M+ in shares, CFO Robertson sold $3M, and EVP Higgins sold $1.9M — that's heavy exec selling. Also, global copper inventories hit 23-year highs which could cap the price. Hold but don't chase — the insiders are taking profits for a reason."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "IREN",
      "action": "trim",
      "reasoning": "Down 3% today at ~$44, getting hit by both the CRWV selloff and BTC weakness. Options flow is aggressively bearish — puts at $40, $56, $57, $70, $75 strikes with high vol/OI ratios and nearly $700K in $40 put premium alone. The Q2 miss (EPS -$0.52 vs -$0.18 est) from Feb 5 led to a Sell downgrade. The MSFT $9.7B contract is the long-term anchor, but near-term sentiment is wrecked."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "CIFR",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "At ~$16.70, down 3% in sympathy with CRWV and BTC. The Q4 miss was ugly ($59.7M rev vs $88.6M est) but the $3.7B HPC financing deal is the real story — that's what popped it 15% on Feb 24. COO Kelly sold $552K pre-earnings. This is a show-me story: if they execute the AI data center pivot, it's a multi-bagger. If not, the $2.71B debt buries them. Hold with tight stops."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NBIS",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "At ~$103-106, pulling back in sympathy with the AI infra selloff. Nvidia-backed with 508% revenue growth expected in 2026. The Tavily acquisition deepens the AI software stack. No insider selling flagged. This is one of the cleaner AI infra names — hold through the volatility but size appropriately given the -9% single-day drops we saw last week."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "MSFT",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "At ~$401, down 17% from recent highs on AI capex rotation fears. The good news: Director Stanton bought $2M in shares on Feb 18 — insider buying at these levels is a confidence signal. Options flow is solidly bullish with $395 calls seeing heavy volume ($1.9M premium). Earnings Apr 29 (61 days). The OpenAI deal through 2032 is the long-term anchor. Patient hold — this is a great company in a bad tape."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "SOXX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "At ~$353, down 1.5%. The semis ETF is caught between NVDA's sell-the-news reaction and the broader tech rotation. No edge here short-term — it goes where NVDA goes. Hold as core AI/semis exposure."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "FBTC",
      "action": "sell",
      "reasoning": "BTC is in a sustained downtrend — 7th consecutive week of weakness, YTD -26.5% for the Canadian ETF. $203M in ETF outflows last week. No clear catalyst for reversal. If you're going to hold crypto exposure, at least wait for BTC to reclaim $65K before re-entering. The opportunity cost of holding this while FCX and industrials are ripping is real."
