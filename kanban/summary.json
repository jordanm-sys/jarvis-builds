  "sentiment": "mixed",
  "overall": "It's a split market right now — your high-beta AI/crypto names are ripping today while MSFT drags and BTC keeps sliding. The big story this week is a wall of earnings: NVDA tonight, CIFR just reported (missed badly but stock loves the HPC deal), and CRWV Thursday. The macro rotation out of tech into cyclicals continues, but your portfolio is positioned more in AI infrastructure than mega-cap tech, so you're actually catching the right side of this move.",
  "picks": [
    {
      "symbol": "NVDA",
      "action": "watch",
      "reasoning": "Reporting TONIGHT after close — this is the single biggest catalyst for your entire portfolio this week. Consensus is ~$65B rev, $1.53 EPS, and options are pricing a massive move. CFO Colette Kress sold ~$8.4M in shares in early Feb, which is routine for her. If Blackwell guidance beats $75B for Q1, this thing re-rates toward $220+. Wait for the print before doing anything."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "CRWV",
      "action": "trim",
      "reasoning": "Earnings Thursday with options pricing a 17% move — that's enormous. But here's what really concerns me: $48.3M in insider selling from THREE C-suite execs (CEO Intrator, CSO Venturo, CDO McBee) across 70 transactions in the last two weeks. The CEO dumped shares at $89-$97. A class action lawsuit was also filed. The $55B backlog is real, but $29B in net debt and this level of insider selling ahead of earnings is a red flag. Take some off the table before Thursday."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "CIFR",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Just reported today — missed badly ($59.7M rev vs $88.6M est, EPS -$1.92 vs -$0.12 est) but the stock is UP 15% because of the $3.7B HPC financing deal. The market is pricing the AI data center pivot, not the crypto mining business. Options flow is heavily bullish with calls stacking at $15-$18 strikes. COO Kelly sold $552K in shares pre-earnings. The pivot story is intact but execution risk is real with $2.71B in debt — hold but keep a tight leash."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMPX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Up 13% today and earnings are in 9 days (Mar 5). CTO Stefan sold ~$7.3M in shares across January — that's a LOT for a $10 stock. Needham has a $20 PT but DCF fair value is only $2.08, which is a massive disconnect. The defense/aerospace battery story is exciting but the valuation is stretched. Hold into earnings but don't add here."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "FCX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Quietly compounding — up 5% today, 4th consecutive green day, copper flirting with $14K/ton records. Double upgrade last week (Freedom Capital $76 PT, Scotiabank $72). BUT Chairman Adkerson sold $25.5M in shares and CFO Robertson sold $3M — that's $18.4M total insider selling from top brass. Copper thesis is strong, Grasberg extension is huge, but insiders are clearly taking profits. Hold for now, earnings Apr 23."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "MU",
      "action": "buy",
      "reasoning": "This is your cleanest setup right now. Zacks #1 Strong Buy, Morgan Stanley PT $450 (stock at $424), 4 analyst upgrades in 60 days, and earnings Mar 18. HBM demand for AI is the real deal. Yes, EVP Sadana sold $10.7M and CLO Ray sold $3.2M, but that's modest relative to the stock price. If NVDA beats tonight, MU rips on sympathy. Best risk/reward in the portfolio heading into earnings."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "IREN",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Up 13% today riding the CIFR sympathy wave. Options flow is mixed — bullish calls at $47-$49 strikes but also bearish puts at $39-$75 with insanely high IV (300%+). The AI cloud pivot is the story ($9.7B MSFT contract, 140K GPU target) but BTC weakness below $64K is a constant headwind. Earnings not until May 13 so no rush — hold and let the AI pivot thesis play out."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NBIS",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Recovering from last week's brutal -9% selloff, up 5% today at $102. Nvidia backing is confirmed, Tavily acquisition deepens the AI software stack, and Zacks named it Bull of the Day with 508% expected revenue growth in 2026. Earnings not until Apr 29. Volatile but the thesis is intact — hold."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "MSFT",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "The portfolio's anchor and today's biggest laggard at -2.3%. Down 21% over 6 months on AI capex concerns — the market wants to see ROI on those Azure/AI investments. Bright spot: Director Stanton bought $2M in shares on Feb 18, which is a bullish signal from an insider. Analysts still have a $592 PT. Earnings Apr 29. Boring but solid — hold. One unusual options alert: $1.2M in deep ITM $345 calls expiring Friday, which reads as bullish positioning."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "TE",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Up 7.6% today on no clear catalyst — could be solar/clean energy momentum. Tax credit confirmation supports the thesis but governance concerns linger after the CAO termination. Earnings Mar 24. Small position, limited data — just hold and see what earnings bring."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "SOXX",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "Semis holding steady at $364, up 1.3%. This is basically an NVDA earnings proxy tonight — if Blackwell beats, SOXX breaks out. If it misses, expect a pullback. High put volume signals hedging. No action needed, just let NVDA do the talking."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "FBTC",
      "action": "hold",
      "reasoning": "BTC is in trouble — broke below $65K, now at $63.7K, 6th consecutive down week. FBTC down 5.7% today to $28.81 CAD. There's no bullish catalyst on the horizon and macro headwinds (tariffs, hawkish Fed) keep piling up. Not saying sell because BTC can snap back violently, but this is the weakest position in the portfolio right now. Hold with low conviction."
