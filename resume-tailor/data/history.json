    "coverLetter": "Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the Canadian CPA Designation Opportunity in Audit and Assurance at KPMG's Montréal office. As a first-year Bachelor of Business Administration student at SFU's Beedie School of Business with a 3.85 GPA and concentrations in accounting and finance, I am committed to pursuing my CPA designation and building a career in audit.\n\nWhat draws me to KPMG is your commitment to developing the next generation of leaders through meaningful client engagement. My academic foundation in financial accounting, where I earned an A+, has given me a solid understanding of the principles that underpin audit and assurance work. Through participating in the ASA Achieve Case Competition, I honed my ability to analyze real-world accounting problems collaboratively — skills that directly align with the team-oriented, quality-driven approach KPMG values. I am also currently deepening my Excel and financial modeling capabilities to be well-prepared for the analytical demands of audit engagements.\n\nBeyond academics, my experience working in a high-pressure restaurant environment taught me to manage competing priorities, maintain quality standards, and collaborate effectively with a team — all skills I am eager to bring to client engagements at KPMG. As a math tutor, I developed the ability to communicate complex information clearly, which I believe is essential when working with clients across different industries.\n\nI am excited about the opportunity to join KPMG's CPA Training Program and contribute to a team that values integrity, excellence, and continuous learning. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and ambitions align with your audit and assurance practice.\n\nSincerely,\nJordan Maragliano",
