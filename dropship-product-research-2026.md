## 🧠 Strategic Recommendations

### For a beginner (Jordan's situation):

1. **Start with 1-2 products max.** Don't spread thin. Pick one from the $20-$40 price range to learn the ropes.

2. **Best starter picks:**
   - **Magnetic Gym Bottle Bag** — Low cost, high margin, easy to demo, fitness niche is massive
   - **Projection Necklace** — Emotional purchases convert like crazy, great for Valentine's/gifting seasons

3. **Best high-ticket pick:** Red Light Therapy Belt — fewer sales needed to hit revenue goals, but requires more trust-building (reviews, content).

4. **Platform recommendation:** Start with Shopify + CJ Dropshipping (faster shipping than AliExpress, better for scaling). Use AliExpress for initial testing/validation.

5. **Marketing stack:**
   - TikTok organic content (free, high reach)
   - Instagram Reels (cross-post TikTok content)
   - Once validated → TikTok Ads / Meta Ads
   - Use UGC-style content (not polished ads)

6. **Supplier tip:** Always order a sample first. Test shipping times. Check packaging quality. Your brand reputation depends on it.
